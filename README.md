# Leukemia-Image-Classification

Problem: 
In 2021, Leukemia was responsible for roughly 4% of all cancer-related deaths in the United States, accounting for around 600,000+ deaths that were caused by cancer. In that same year, there were approximately 23,660 instances of leukemia reported. According to projections made by the American Cancer Society, there will be about 60,650 new cases of leukemia and 24,000 leukemia-related deaths in the United States in 2022. 11,540 people have died from leukemia. Leukemia typically affects elderly patients and kids can also develop leukemia.

Background: 
Leukemia originates in blood-forming tissues like bone marrow. The cells that will mature into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets are produced in the bone marrow. Each type of cell performs a distinct function: Platelets help form clots to halt bleeding. White blood cells assist your body fight infection. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs.
When a person has leukemia, their bone marrow produces an abundance of abnormal cells. This condition most commonly affects white blood cells. These aberrant cells accumulate in your blood and bone marrow. They displace healthy blood cells and make it difficult for your cells and blood to function. As a result, leukemia patients are more likely to have no symptoms before being diagnosed.

Relevance: 
Because an early diagnosis of leukemia can improve a patient's prognosis, it's important to test for it if there's even a distant chance.
Manual microscopic leukocyte analysis, one of the current diagnostic procedures for ALL, involves counting normal and aberrant leukocytes in peripheral blood smears.
Due to increased computing power, image analysis and pattern recognition algorithms are used to examine blood cells. These technologies improve computer-assisted microscopy (CAM) analysis. A system based on image processing boosts precision and speed while saving time, labor, and money.

Objectives: 
Image processing enables the early detection of anomalies and the acceleration of diagnosis, making it preferable to more conventional methods of detection in order to provide patients with sufficient time to obtain the appropriate treatment. Our ultimate objective is to make a constructive contribution to society and serve as an effective weapon in the ongoing war against cancer.
